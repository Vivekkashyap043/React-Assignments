        <p>
        Vue is a front-end JavaScript framework written in JavaScript.
        Similar frameworks to Vue are React and Angular, but Vue is more lightweight and easier to start with.
        Vue is distributed as a JavaScript file, and can be added to a web page with a script tag:
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Vue
